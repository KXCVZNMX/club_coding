# Lesson 2: Write your first program in C++!

After your IDE and installations are setup, now its time to start coding in C++!

## Create a working directory
First, create a new folder to store your files, name it `hello_world`. You can achieve this either in the normal way, through your file explorer, or if you know how to use `cd` and `mkdir`, that is viable as well.

Then, open that folder in VSCode, by pressing `âŒ˜ + O` or `Ctrl + K + O` on windows, and then choosing the folder you just created.

Now, create a new file named `hello_world.cpp`, and we are all set!
